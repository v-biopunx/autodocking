This script automatically clicks the buttons in Hermes to run the docking
of beta tubulin subunits to ivermectin. Hermes GUI needs to be opened prior to 
running the program and the script needs to be placed in a folder with files
that represent protein subunits and the ligand. Modyfying the path to the folder
is also required for the script to run properly.
